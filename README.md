# Financial-Data-Analysis

Abstract:

This project utilizes SQL on MySQL Server and Tableau Visualizations to extract, process, and visually represent financial loan data. Specifically, the focus is on Prosper Loan Data, aiming to extract actionable insights. The project involves creating a MySQL database through the "data local infile" method and calculating Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) related to Loan Portfolio Metrics, Financial Performance, and Borrower Metrics. These insights are then presented through a Tableau Dashboard for enhanced graphical representation.
